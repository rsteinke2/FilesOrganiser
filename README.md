# FilesOrganiser
This Python script organizes files in the Downloads folder by categorizing them into subfolders based on their file extensions. It creates folders for images, documents, videos, music, archives, and executables, then moves files accordingly. Run the script to keep your Downloads folder clean and sorted automatically. ðŸš€
